```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an RMD file

You can use # to mark a heading
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### And so on

You can also surround characters with * to make things *bold* and _ to make things _italics_

Or use * or - to make bullet points
* bullet one
* bullet two

- bullet three

But all of this will only show up when you have "knit" this .rmd file to a .pdf or .doc or .html file. You can do this by clicking "knit" from the dropdown menu at the top of the editor window
```{r}
x <- seq(1:10)
y <- 2*x +4

plot(x, y)

```
